        subtitle="who, what, and why?" 
        info="Ebixia has a new group in town, and they're taking the world by storm. Alex Drake, Geddy Splintwalker, Shinzo Katetsu, Fainne Uron of the Crannach Timberlands, Hollyanna Knox, Empress Isa Tenju, and Bael Volet. Those seven people make up an organization known as The Outsiders, a name that has spread to nearly every corner of Ebixia. But who are these people? Why did they appear? Who do they answer to? Our research took us to the streets of New Ordis. Reportedly, that group arrived on the scene to fight a dragon that slept beneath the city. They fought alongside New Ordis military and were victorious. That really set the team on the map. Their symbol, recognizable to many across the lands, is a dragon to celebrate their victory. Many have said that, since that day, they've appeared in other places across Ebixia to do much of the same. They fought monsters in the streets of Sanctuary and brought war to the shores of Bao. Allegedly, they are responsible for the disappearance of several government officials in the town of Ternathus including Ralion 'Thunderclasp', Millor 'Waterdancer', Drundarr 'Earthbreaker'. Eyewitness reports can confirm they were directly responsible for dethroning Emperor Shenlong Yuya." />
